## Should we be afraid of negative reviews? A study of customer reviews on Amazon.
Sellers treat bad reviews as threat and a risk for the product. No doubt, for the online shopping, bad reviews also directly affect the customersâ€™ purchase tendency. I will use machine learning to assess whether bad rating has carryover effect and how the bad reviews provide information for helpfulness.

#### Test whether specific ordering of bad star-rating affects the following reviews?   

### Goal 2 Develop classifier to predict helpfulness based on the contexts in bad reviews?
